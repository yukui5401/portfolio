## Portfolio website

### Setup
To use the email feature, create an API key from [Resend](https://resend.com/).

1. Add `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable in `.env.local`
2. In the `send-email.ts` action file, change the "to" email to your own email

### Inspiration
This porfolio was inspired by [Ben Rogers](https://github.com/ben04rogers/portfolio-v2), who deserves credit for the design and layout of the website.
